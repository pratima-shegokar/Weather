Pratima's Solution for Kodtest for Telia.
=========================================


### Problem Statement
Develop an App to display current weather and forecast of next 5 days using openweathermap's API.


### Solution
As specified in the problem statement, I worked on the problem statement for 3 hours only. 
I have implemented current weather for 3 cities listed below
- Stockholm
- Pune
- Malm√∂

Things that I have used (found challenging) for this test.
1. Having good UI
2. Calling api - Async network calls
3. JSON parsing

### Things that could be done better
- Use of icons to display current condition
- Use of networking library eg: volley or retrofit or okhttp
- Generating POJO's for the response JSON for easier interfacing
- Using gson or jackson for gson for object mapping
- In general better UI, currently I am just using TextViews.
- Having tests
